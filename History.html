		<h1>The history of Java Programming Language</h1>
	<p>Java Programming Language was written by James Gosling along with two other person 'Mike Sheridan' and 'Patrick Naughton', while they were working at Sun Microsystems. Initially it was named oak Programming Language.</p>


      <ol type="i">
        <li>Initial Java Versions 1.0 and 1.1 was released in the year 1996 for Linux, Solaris, Mac and Windows.</li>
        <li>Java version 1.2 (Commonly called as java 2) was released in the year 1998.</li>
        <li>Java Version 1.3 codename Kestrel was released in the year 2000..</li>
        <li>Java Version 1.4 codename Merlin was released in the year 2002.</li>
        <li>Java Version 1.5/Java SE 5 codename 'Tiger' was released in the year 2004.</li>
        <li>Java Version 1.6/Java SE 6 Codename ‘Mustang’ was released in the year 2006.</li>
        <li>Java Version 1.7/Java SE 7 Codename ‘Dolphin’ was released in the year 2011.</li>
        <li>Java Version 1.8 is the current stable release which was released this year (2015).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Five Goals taken into consideration, while developing Java:</p>

      <ol type="i">
        <li>Keep it simple, familiar and object oriented.</li>
        <li>Keep it Robust and Secure.</li>
        <li>Keep it architecture-neural and portable.</li>
        <li>Executable with High Performance.</li>
        <li>Interpreted, threaded and dynamic.</li>
      </ol>

	<p><img src="image/java_history.jpg" alt="Java History img" align="left" /> Why we call it Java 2, Java 5, Java 6, Java 7 and Java 8, not their actual version number which 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8?
	Java 1.0 and 1.1 were Java. When Java 1.2 was released it had a lots of changes and marketers/developers wanted a new name so they called it Java 2 (J2SE), remove the numeric before decimal.
	This was not the condition when Java 1.3 and Java 1.4 were released hence they were never called Java 3 and Java 4, but they were still Java 2.
	When Java 5 was released, once again it was having a lots of changes for the developer/marketers and need a new name. The next number in sequence was 3, but calling Java 1.5 as Java 3 was confusing hence a decision was made to keep the naming as per version number and till now the legacy continues.
	Java is implemented over a number of places in modern world. It is implemented as Standalone Application, Web Application, Enterprise Application and Mobile Application. Games, Smart Card, Embedded System, Robotics, Desktop, etc.
	Keep connected we are coming up with &#34;Working and code Structure of Java&#34;.</p>

			<h2>What is Java 2 Micro Edition?</h2>
				<h3>Java 2 Micro Edition(J2ME):</h3>

				<p>Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) provides a robust, flexible environment for applications running on embedded and mobile devices in the Internet of Things: micro-controllers, sensors, gateways, mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), TV set-top boxes, printers and more. Java ME includes flexible user interfaces, robust security, built-in network protocols, and support for networked and offline applications that can be downloaded dynamically. Applications based on Java ME are portable across many devices, yet leverage each device's native capabilities.</p>

				<p>Java Platform, Micro Edition, or Java ME, is a Java platform designed for embedded systems (mobile devices are one kind of such systems). Target devices range from industrial controls to mobile phones (especially feature phones) and set-top boxes. Java ME was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME).</p>

				<h3>History of J2me:</h3>

				<h4>Java on mobile devices history </h4>

				<ul type="square">
				  <li>1990: Java started as an internal project at Sun Microsystems</li>
				  <li>1996: Initial release of JDK 1.0 (applets servlets)</li>
				  <li>1999: JavaOne conference</li>

					<ul>
					  <h4>Subdivision of Java in:</h4>
					  <li>Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE)</li>
					  <li>Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE)</li>
					  <li>Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) (successor ofPersonal Java and Embedded Java)</li>
					  <li>2000/01 First mobile phones with support for J2ME</li>
					  <li>2002: Second version of Mobile Information</li>
					  <li>Device Profile (MIDP 2.0)</li>
					  <li>April 2004: 250 Million mobile phones support J2ME</li>
					  <li>October 2004: 1700 Million mobile phones support J2ME</li>
					</ul></ul>

					<p>Now: most vendors of mobile phones (Motorola, Nokia, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Siemens, Sony Ericsson, Toshiba, etc.) provide mobile phones that support J2ME</p>
				</ul>

				<h3>Connected, Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) in  J2ME:</h3>
				<p>Here Specifies the Java environment for mobile phone, pager and wireless devices
			  in CLDC devices are usually wireless 160 - 512k of memory available for Java
			 typically has limited power or battery operated network connectivity, often wireless, intermittent, low-bandwidth (9600bps or less)</p>

			 <h3>Connected Device Configuration (CDC) in  J2ME :</h3>
			 <p>Here Describes the Java environment for digital television set-top boxes, high end wireless devices and automotive telematics systems.
			 device is powered by a 32-bit processor 2MB or more of total memory available for Java
			 network connectivity, often wireless, intermittent, low-bandwidth (9600bps or less)
			 These two configurations differ only in their respective memory and display capabilities.</p>

			 <h3>J2ME Profiles:</h3>

			 <p>A profile complements a configuration by adding additional classes that provide features appropriate to a particular type of device or to a specific vertical market segment. Both J2ME configurations have one or more associated profiles, some of which may themselves rely on other profiles. These processes are described in the following list:</p>

			 <h3>Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP):</h3>

			 <p>The PDA Profile is similar to MIDP, but it is aimed at PDAs that have better screens and more memory than cell phones. The PDA profile, which is not complete at the time of writing, will offer a more sophisticated user interface library and a Java-based 1 It could be argued that CLDC breaks this rule with its networking classes, because there is no usable subset of the java.net package that would fit into the restricted memory available to a CLDC-based device. This problem is solved by creating a new package that contains a more lightweight set of networking classes. API for accessing useful features of the host operating system. When this profile becomes available, it is likely to take over from MIDP as the J2ME platform for small handheld computers such as those from Palm and Handspring.</p>

			 <h3>Foundation Profile:</h3>

			 <p>The Foundation Profile extends the CDC to include almost all of the core Java 2 Version 1.3 core libraries. As its name suggests, it is intended to be used as the basis for most of the other CDC profiles.</p>

			 <h3> Personal Basis and Personal Profiles:</h3>

			 <p>The Personal Basis Profile adds basic user interface functionality to the Foundation Profile. It is intended to be used on devices that have an unsophisticated user interface capability, and it therefore does not allow more than one window to be active at any time. Platforms that can support a more complex user interface will use the Personal Profile instead. At the time of writing, both these profiles are in the process of being specified.</p>

			 <h3>RMI Profile:</h3>

			 <p>The RMI Profile adds the J2SE Remote Method Invocation libraries to the Foundation Profile. Only the client side of this API is supported.</p>

			 <h3>Game Profile:</h3>

			 <p>The Game Profile, which is still in the process of being defined, will provide a platform for writing games software on CDC devices. At the time of writing, it is not certain whether this profile will be derived from the Foundation Profile or based directly on CDC.</p>

			 <h3>J2ME Architecture:</h3>
			 <p>There are 5 layers in J2ME Architecture.Those are:</p>

			 <ol type="i">
				<li><mark>MIDP (TopMost Layer):</mark> Which contains Java APIs for user network connections, persistence storage, and the user interface. It also has access to CLDC libraries and MIDP libraries.</li>

				<li><mark>J2ME API’s(Profiles):</mark> Which consists of the minimum set of application programming interfaces for the small computing device</li>

				<li><mark>Configurations:</mark> Which handles interactions between the profile and the JVM.</li>

				<li><mark>JVM</mark></li>

				<li><mark>Operating System(Bottom Layer)</mark></li>
			 </ol>
			 <p> 1,2 and 3 are software Layers.</p>

			 <h3>Difference between J2ME and Android devices :</h3>
			 <p>The big difference between J2ME and Android is primarily about interaction, since both J2ME and Android support almost all of the same basic features (syncing, playing videos, etc). Android phones let users interact with data in lots of ways, J2ME phones force users interact with data in one or two ways. If you want to be scanning barcodes to look up patients and save a bunch of forms to finish later, Android is great. If your user population is highly illiterate and has no technical experience, J2ME works much better. It's super important for low-literacy users to have guided, imperative user interfaces, and that isn't available on Android yet.</p>

						<th>&nbsp;</th><th>Android Devices</th><th>J2ME Devices</th>
					</tr>
					<tr class="odd">
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>Equipped with:
						Camera: enabling image capture or barcode use cases
						•	GPS: enables GIS use cases. Note that constantly using GPS drains the battery life on phones.
						Android phones can also be configured to capture data using custom code written by third parties, which allows integration with novel data capture techniques like receiving data from Bluetooth medical devices.
						</td>
						<td>However, for Image capture or bar code use cases, Androids are recommended.
						J2ME can do GPS collection; however, this tends to make the phone as expensive as an Android. Additionally, GPS on J2ME requires running the S60 operating system, which is complex and generally less liked than the streamlined S40 operating system used in most CommCare projects.
						</td>
					</tr>

					<tr class="even">
						<td>User Interface</td>
						<td>The Android user interface is very flexible due to touchscreens and overall screen size. Android phones allow for much more complex workflows like scanning barcodes to search for items, navigating over filled out form content to check and correct answers quickly, saving and resuming incomplete forms, etc.
						The Android phone interface (outside of CommCare) is much more intuitive in most ways than J2ME, although it is also very easy to accidentally exit the application or provide accidental input.
						Not many users are already familiar with the user interface of Android phones, which means that they must be trained for the common features (touch screen buttons, navigation, etc.), but also means that they don't often have competing expectations for what the application's interface should do. After the initial learning curve of becoming familiar with a touch interface, Android phones are typically easier to use and have a better user experience, even for community health workers.
						</td>
						<td>J2ME's interface is limited, but also very streamlined. It is much easier to configure a CommCare app in J2ME, which guides users through the process, since the app can take over the full function of the device.
						Many users also find that interacting with physical buttons is much more straightforward than touchscreen interfaces, although it is very dependent on their background and technical experience.
						The S40 interface on Nokia phones (outside of the CommCare application) is difficult to use, and requires a substantial amount of training for CHW's unfamiliar with it unless CommCare is set as a shortcut on the home screen. Re-setting dates or other phone-specific settings is difficult for most CHW's, however.
						Many users are already familiar with the form factor and interface of Nokia S40 phones due to their prevalence.

					</tr>

					<tr class="odd">
							<td>Display</td>
							<td>While the displays on Android are much bigger and therefore may be better for users with poor eyesight, they can also be harder to see in the sunlight.</td>
							<td>J2ME displays are often optimized for visibility in very bright conditions, but are physically much smaller.
							It is more difficult to share video or image content between people using the j2me screen, since it is smaller. The viewing angles are sometimes better than on resistive Android screens, however.
							</td>
					</tr>

					<tr class="even">
							<td>Recommended level of tech capacity of CHWs</td>
							<td>Users with low technical capacities have used ODK in the past with success, but many of the workflows (the login screen, the difference between "saving" and "sending" forms) can be challenging for initial adoption. We are continually improving and simplifying the Android user interface.
							Many of the widgets (date selection, multi-select) are much easier to use with a touchscreen.
							ODK is usable by a broad set of CHW's, but those with high technical skills will gain a lot of benefit from the more advanced features, which are easier to learn on Android.
							Android is recommended for advanced users who will be managing complex workflows, and for users who are not particularly technically savvy, but are highly literate and have a lot of potential to adapt to the new interfaces.
							</td>
							<td>CommCare J2ME supports "sense" mode, which is designed to be used by users with very low technical capacity and has been successful with illiterate first-time-phone users in the past with minimal training.
							The app is also very familiar to users who are used to using S40 phones for advanced tasks like web browsing, although in mixed populations (of low and high technical capacity users) who are forced to share the same app, advanced users are often frustrated at the inefficiency of the sense interface.
							J2ME is recommended for very, very low-technical capacity users, or for users who are comfortable with using Nokia style phones, but may be limiting for very advanced users.
							</td>
					</tr>

					<tr class="odd">
							<td>Maintenance</td>
							<td>Android phones generally require very little configuration, and it is easy to push automatic updates. When phone hardware is damaged, there is less local support, however.
							Android devices have an extremely high turnover rates on the market, and very few receive good support over time. Phones which have hardware problems or are lost are likely to be replaced by a new device, which may cause difficulties aligning specifications.
							Typically, touch screen phones are less robust, and can be broken easily if dropped. The screens are also prone to cracking.
							</td>
							<td>J2ME phones require a great degree of (fairly finicky) manual configuration which can be wiped when it runs out of battery or a SIM card is moved, increasing the need for on-hands maintenance.
							There is better support for J2ME phones in most local shops, although there have been problems in the past with local establishments swapping batteries (authentic for knock-off), re-flashing phones with invalid operating systems, filling the memory card with multimedia, or deleting the multimedia files used by the CommCare application.
							J2ME phones are in general, very robust, and designed for repetitive use in challenging environments.
							</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="even">
						<td>Cost</td>
						<td>Android prices vary widely country to country and in some locations can be found as cheap as the Nokia phones that run CommCare. However, they are still typically 30-50 USD more than J2ME phones in local markets (although this is rapidly changing)
						Additionally, the lowest-end android phones are generally substantially slower and less functional than a the lowest-end CommCare compatible J2ME phone.
						</td>
						<td>J2ME phones still tend to be cheaper than Android, although that cost gap is rapidly narrowing.
						Cheap J2ME phones tend to be fairly robust, and may not need to be replaced as often as cheap Android phones.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="odd">
						<td>Availability</td>
						<td>Androids are becoming cheaper and more common, although availability of phones made for specific markets is still tenuous. It is common for Android phones to not support local languages and dialects.</td>
						<td>In 2010, Nokia made a strategic decision to move away from lower end phones and adopted the Windows Mobile operating system. This leaves a significant amount of uncertainty about how much longer low end Nokia phones running the Symbian Operating System will be available in the marketplace.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr class="even">
						<td>Externalities</td>
						<td>Providing CommCare phones to advanced users will also enable them to take advantage of the multitude of free software available on the platform which could increase their performance or make their jobs easier. Integrated Maps and Email are sometimes used in advanced deployments to help workers plan visits and communicate from the field.</td>
						<td>J2ME phones are fairly inconspicuous. Even though CommCare compatible J2ME phones are often more expensive than the average phone on the market, they look similar, and thus don't raise suspicion that workers are performing visits.
						They are also less likely to be the target of theft directly (although as mentioned in Maintenance, their SD cards and batteries are)
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="odd">
						<td>Lock Down</td>
						<td>Androids have the capability to lock down different phone functions in order to restrict certain usage. For example restrict access to Browsers, Social Media Networks, etc. Google Play offers multiple apps for doing so and a couple of them successfully tested on the field.</td>
						<td>J2ME phones are much, much more difficult to lock down. There are a few things a user can do to the phone that will cause CommCare to stop working until someone with more technical experience can restore the correct settings (swapping batteries, changing sim cards, filling the SDCard with multimedia, removing the multimedia CommCare uses, incorrect time/date settings). Most of these issues are not present on Android operating systems.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="even">
						<td>Automatic Update</td>
						<td>Android CommCare applications are easily able to automatically update to the latest build or version of software, including the binary CommCare application, and also the form content and questions. As of now, multimedia still cannot be automatically updated.</td>
						<td>Automatic application update is possible on J2ME phones, but isn't as reliable as on Android devices. Furthermore, only application content (form questions, new forms) can be updated, and new versions of CommCare need to be installed manually. Updates to multimedia require manual intervention as well.</td>
