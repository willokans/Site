		<h1>Tools needed to develop Android App</h1>
			<p>Although android apps can be made using nothing but a text editor, it is recommended to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  It is a complete suite, with a host of utilities and tools supplementing a text editor with the aim to ease the process of app-development.</p>
			<p>There are loads of IDE out there that can be used for Mobile App development but the most popular IDE in practice is the ADT bundle on Eclipses and also Android Studio developed specifically for Android platform development.</p>
			<p>The ADT Bundle provides everything you need to start developing apps, including a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to streamline your Android app development</p>
		<h2>System/External  Requirements</h2>
			<p>You will need a decent PC as a Development Machine with developing Android App else your life will become hell as you can neither run the Android Emulators(RAM Hogger) nor the Genymotion Emulator(HAMX Required)</p>
			<p>Below shows the minimum PC specification needed to successfully develop an Android App. 
			<p><b>Windows</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Microsoft® Windows® 7/8/10 (32- or 64-bit)</li>

				<li>Microsoft® Windows® 7/8/10 (32- or 64-bit) </br>
				4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)</li>
				<li>1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution</li>
				<li>For accelerated emulator: 64-bit operating system and Intel® processor with support for Intel® VT-x, Intel® EM64T (Intel® 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Mac:</b></p>

				<li>•	2 GB of available disk space minimum,
					4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
				</li>
				<li>1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Linux:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>GNOME or KDE desktop </br>
					<i>Tested on Ubuntu® 12.04, Precise Pangolin (64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications)</i></li>
					<li>64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications</li>
					<li>GNU C Library (glibc) 2.11 or later</li>
					<li>2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended</li>
					<li>•	2 GB of available disk space minimum,
						4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
					</li>
					<li>1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution</li>
					<li>For accelerated emulator: Intel® processor with support for Intel® VT-x, Intel® EM64T (Intel® 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality, or AMD processor with support for AMD Virtualization™ (AMD-V™)</li>

			<h2>Installing Software Requirement </h2>
				<p>Now that we have dealt with the external interface requirement needed, lets now look into what is needed at the software level</p>
				<p>Android Requires some basic software setup like: </br>
				ADK(Tools which include a lot of Android goodies, like adb, aapt, and a whole set of libraries provided by google, which include design library, V4, V7, V13 Compatibility Libraries, google maps, google APIs, etc), 
				</p>
				<p>Java (7 or 8, 8 is even better as it can support Lambdas used for RxJava, else you need to do some hacks to satisfy on Java 7)</p>
			<h2>Java Development Kit(JDK)</h2>
			<p>The Java Development Kit (JDK ) is the software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.</p>
			<p>People new to Java may be confused about whether to use the JRE or the JDK. To run Java applications and applets, simply download the JRE. However, to develop Java applications and applets as well as run them, the JDK is needed.</p>
			<p>For developers who wish to work in an integrated development environment (IDE), a JDK bundled with Eclipse can be downloaded from the Oracle website. Such IDEs speed up the development process by introducing point-and-click and drag-and-drop features for creating an application.</p>
			<p>There are different JDKs for various platforms. The supported platforms include Windows, Linux and Solaris. Mac users need a different software development kit, which includes adaptations of some tools found in the JDK.</p>
			<p><b>TO install the lastest version of JDK to out machine, use the link below</br>
			<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">Java Development Kids (JDK)</a>
			</b></p>
			<p>When installing on Windows you also need to set JAVA_HOME Environment Variable according to your JDK installation path</p>

			 <h2>Setting environment variables</h2>
			 	<p>Android require some environment variables to be set in order to function correctly. The CLI will attempt to set these variables for you, but in certain cases you may need to set them manually. The following variables should be updated:</p>

			 	<ol>
			 		<li>Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK installation</li>
			 		<li>Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to the location of your Android SDK installation</li>
			 		<li>It is also recommended that you add the Android SDK's tools and platform-tools directories to your PATH</li>
			 	</ol>

			 	<h2>OS X and Linux</h2>
			 		<p>On a Mac or Linux, you can use a text editor to create or modify the ~/.bash_profile file. To set an environment variable, add a line that uses export like so (substitute the path with your local installation):</p>
			 		<p><i>export ANDROID_HOME=/Development/android-sdk/</i></p>
			 		<p>To update your PATH, add a line resembling the following (substitute the paths with your local Android SDK installation's location):</p>			
			 		<p><i>export PATH=${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk/tools</i></p>
			 		<p>Reload your terminal to see this change reflected or run the following command:</p>
			 		<p><i>$ source ~/.bash_profile</i></p>

			 		<h2>Windows</h2>
			 		<p>These steps may vary depending on your installed version of Windows. Close and reopen any command prompt windows after making changes to see them reflected
			 		<ol>
			 			<li>Click on the Start menu in the lower-left corner of the desktop</li>
			 			<li>In the search bar, search for Environment Variables and select Edit the system Environment Variables from the options that appear</li>
			 			<li>In the window that appears, click the Environment Variables button</li>

			 		</ol></p>

			 	<h3>To create a new environment variable:</h3>
			 		<ol>
			 			<li>Click New... and enter the variable name and value</li>
			 		</ol>
			 	<h3>To set your PATH:</h3>
			 		<ol>
			 			<li>Select the PATH variable and press Edit.</li>
			 			<li>2.	Add entries for the relevant locations to the PATH. For example (substitute the paths with your local Android SDK installation's location):</li>
			 			<li>C:\Development\android-sdk\platform-tools.</li>
			 			<li>C:\Development\android-sdk\tools</li>
			 		</ol>
			 	<h2>Android SDK</h2>
			 		<p>Android SDK (software development kit) is a set of development tools used to develop applications for Android platform. The Android SDK includes the following:
			 		<ol>
			 			<li>Required libraries</li>
			 			<li>Debugger</li>
			 			<li>An emulator</li>
			 			<li>Relevant documentation for the Android application program interfaces (APIs)</li>
			 			<li>Sample source code </li>
			 			<li>Tutorials for the Android OS </li>
			 		</ol></p>
			 		<p>The development platforms that are compatible with SDK include operating systems like Windows (XP or later), Linux (any recent Linux distribution) and Mac OS X (10.4.9 or later). The components of Android SDK can be downloaded separately. Third party add-ons are also available for download.</p>
			 		<p>Although the SDK can be used to write Android programs in the command prompt, the most common method is by using an integrated development environment (IDE). The recommended IDE is Eclipse with the Android Development Tools (ADT) plug-in. However, other IDEs, such as NetBeans or IntelliJ, will also work. Most of these IDEs provide a graphical interface enabling developers to perform development tasks faster. Since Android applications are written in Java code, a user should have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.</p>
			 		<p>Install the Android Stand-alone SDK Tools or Android Studio. Proceed with Android Studio if you plan on developing new Cordova for Android plugins or using native tools to run and debug the Android platform. Otherwise, the Android Stand-alone SDK Tools are enough to build and deploy Android applications.</p>
